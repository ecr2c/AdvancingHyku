The Advancing Hyku team is delighted to share our project update for the period ending September 1, 2020. How did a whole year go by on this project (and in these odd times) already?

First, the up to date roadmap (click image for full resolution view):

Development is under way, complete with community code contributions. The following work has been completed by Ubiquity Press, and has been approved by the Hyku/Samvera community for contribution back to the Hyku/Hyrax Core codebase\*

- Code contribution by Ubiquity Press team to standardize and align core infrastructure of the Hyku codebase with the Hyrax codebase. Specifically, Upgrade Hyku to Hyrax 2.9, Rails 5.2, and Ruby 2.7. <https://github.com/samvera/hyku/pull/1632>
- Making it easier to customize the deposit form by adding Google Scholar meta tags: <https://github.com/samvera/hyrax/pull/4382>
- Allowing easier extension and customization of the deposit form UI:  
    <https://github.com/samvera/hyrax/pull/4440>  
    <https://github.com/samvera/hyrax/pull/4453>
- Port infrastructure for remote identifiers such as DOIs: <https://github.com/samvera/hyrax/pull/4458>

\*Codebase: Hyku codebase allows for institutions with smaller technical resource pools to get a repository up and running quickly and maintain it efficiently; Hyrax codebase allows for institutions with more significant development resources to customize repository functionality for specific institutional requirements.

#### Team Recruitment

- Ilkay Holt, of Turkey’s [Özyeğin University](https://www.ozyegin.edu.tr/en) and [COAR](https://www.coar-repositories.org/), joined as British Library’s [Advancing Hyku Project Lead](https://britishlibrary.recruitment.zellis.com/birl/pages/vacancy.jsf?latest=01002166) in July. Her first action was a formalization and significant enhancement of the project communication plan, and now she is hard at work ensuring opportunities for Samvera Community input on Advancing Hyku.

#### Community Project Collaboration

In true Samvera Community tradition, our work continues to generate discussion and collaboration with other community projects. Of note:

The project team regularly takes part in communication channels, especially Hyku Roadmap alignment work this summer. Chris Colvard is leading our effort to keep the [Advancing Hyku Project Roadmap](https://advancinghyku.io//srv/htdocs/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Roadmap-AH-BigPage-15Sep2020-1024x402.png) aligned with the [Hyku Community Roadmap](https://wiki.lyrasis.org/display/samvera/Hyku+Roadmap) as well as contributing to Hyku community feature development, while Ilkay Holt is enabling community input pathways for Hyku feature prioritization and functionality.

Within the Samvera Hyku Interest Group, the project team continues to collaborating with [Hyrax Analytics](https://www.imls.gov/grants/awarded/lg-36-19-0033-19) to divide and conquering metrics and analytics, rather than duplicating similar yet distinct aspects of these frequently-requested features. At the same time, [Hyku for Consortia](https://www.hykuforconsortia.org/) and Advancing Hyku are partnering to prioritize contribution of Ubiquity Press code, developed for British Library’s Hyku multi-tenant [Shared Research Repository](https://iro.bl.uk/), into the community Hyku 2 codebase as a prerequisite for future Hyku projects.
